# COVID-19 Impact on the United States: A Data Visualization Project

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected many parts of society, including health, the economy, and people's daily lives. Understanding these effects is important. This project looks at how COVID-19 has impacted the United States, focusing on key areas like infection rates, deaths, vaccination, unemployment, and poverty.

Using Tableau, this project creates easy-to-understand visualizations that explore the many impacts of the pandemic. These visualizations help users see trends, find connections, and understand how different states have been affected over time.

## Background of the Project
The project draws upon multiple datasets covering various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impacts. These datasets include COVID-19 case numbers, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, unemployment rates, and poverty rates across different states in the United States. 

By integrating and visualizing these datasets, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and correlations related to the pandemic's impact on public health and socio-economic conditions. The objective is to enhance understanding of how COVID-19 has affected different regions and populations.

## Ambitiousness of the Project
This project takes on a big task by bringing together different types of data to give a complete picture of the pandemic's impact. It combines COVID-19 case and death data with information on unemployment, poverty, and vaccination rates. The project provides both state-level and national insights, highlighting regional disparities and trends.

This dual perspective is crucial for understanding the varied impact of COVID-19 across different geographic areas. This helps us understand the pandemic's effects on different states and groups of people in a detailed way, showing differences and trends.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis shows a significant increase in unemployment rates across all states during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The unemployment rates spiked in 2020 and gradually decreased in the following years as the pandemic's immediate economic impacts began to subside. This trend is consistent across the states, indicating a nationwide impact of the pandemic on employment.

The analysis on COVID-19's influence on poverty rates across different states reveals a mixed impact. While some states saw an increase in poverty rates, others experienced a decrease. This variation could be attributed to differing local economic conditions, state-level policies, and federal assistance programs. The data suggests that the pandemic had complex socio-economic effects that varied significantly from one state to another.

The severity index map indicates that states like California, Texas, and Florida experienced the highest severity levels, as reflected by the higher number of cases and deaths. These states were among the most affected throughout the pandemic, likely due to their larger populations and urban centers, which can facilitate the virus's spread.

The vaccination rate map shows significant variability in vaccination coverage across states. States with higher vaccination rates generally had lower total case counts, suggesting the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in controlling the spread of the virus. However, some highly populated states with high vaccination rates still reported substantial case numbers, indicating that other factors, such as public health policies and population density, also play critical roles.
